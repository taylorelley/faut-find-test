title: "Production‚ÄêLine QualityCheck Troubleshooting Exercise"
overview: |
  This simulation presents a production line where raw ingredients are mixed, formed into sheets, baked, and then routed into separate sweet and savory branches.
  Sweet sheets receive frosting, savory sheets receive seasoning, and both converge at a QualityCheck before final packing. Use the information below to identify the misbehaving machine.

test_results:
  sweet:
    heading: "Sweet Production Run (Working)"
    status: success
    details: |
      A batch of sweet items using the sweet recipe at RawMixer
      passes through Sheeter, Oven, Splitter, FrostingLine, and QualityCheck,
      then moves on to ShadingLamp and Packer successfully.
  savory:
    heading: "Savory Production Run (Failing)"
    status: failure
    details: |
      A batch of savory items using the savory recipe at RawMixer
      follows the path through Sheeter, Oven, Splitter, SpiceLine, and
      reaches QualityCheck but is always marked 'defective' and rejected,
      despite no visible defects.
  spot_checks:
    heading: "Spot‚ÄêChecks at Each Machine"
    status: info
    details: |
      - RawMixer: Dough consistency and texture pass for both sweet and savory.
      - Sheeter: Sheet thickness is correct for both types.
      - Oven: Temperature logs confirm 180 ¬∞C and correct bake time; sheets have expected firmness and color.
      - Splitter: Sensor confirms sweet sheets route to SL, savory to SVL.
      - FrostingLine: Available only for sweet; frosting is applied correctly.
      - SpiceLine: Available only for savory; seasoning amount is correct.
      - QualityCheck: When sweet arrives, cameras and sensors confirm frosting and QC accepts them; when savory arrives, cameras show correct seasoning but QC rejects every savory sheet.
      - ShadingLamp: Receives and passes sweet items; never receives savory because QC rejects them.
      - Packer: Packages accepted items only (receives none from savory).

  ping:
    heading: "Machine‚Äêto‚ÄêMachine Handshake Tests (All Working)"
    status: success
    results:
      - "RM ‚Üí SH"
      - "SH ‚Üí OV"
      - "OV ‚Üí SPT"
      - "SPT ‚Üí FR"

      - "SPC ‚Üí QC"
      - "QC ‚Üí SHD"
      - "SHD ‚Üí PK"
  note: |
    All handshake tests succeed‚Äîno machine is physically offline or disconnected.

hints:
  - "Observe that every machine in the dynamic (sweet) path functions normally, as sweet items pass end-to-end."
  - "Savory items fail only at QualityCheck, even though upstream machines (RawMixer through SpiceLine) report correct operation."
  - "All handshake (ping‚Äêanalog) tests succeed, so no machine is completely offline."
  - "QualityCheck accepts sweet items but rejects every savory item despite correct seasoning."
  - "Therefore the issue must lie in QualityCheck‚Äôs internal inspection logic for savory items."

validation:
  correct_answer: "QC"
  success_feedback: "Correct! QualityCheck (QC) is faulty. It misclassifies every savory sheet as defective, even though all upstream steps and machine handshakes are working correctly and sweet items pass QC without issue."
  failure_feedback: "Incorrect. The faulty machine is QC. All upstream machines (RM through SPC) operate normally for savory items, but QC rejects all savory sheets despite correct seasoning and machine handshakes. This indicates a problem within QualityCheck itself."
