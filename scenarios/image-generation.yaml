title: "Image Processing Pipeline Troubleshooting Exercise"
overview: |
  This simulation presents a real‐time image processing pipeline where camera feeds are normalized, split for parallel analytics,
  and also sent for batch archival.  Real‐time analytics detect anomalies and generate alerts, while batch archives compress 
  images before storing.  Use the information below to identify the misbehaving device.

paths:

  - title: "Real‐Time Analytics Path"
    description: "SP → AD → AL and SP → FE → AG → AL"
    note: "Splitter feeds two parallel analytics branches: AnomalyDetector for immediate alerts, and FeatureExtractor → Aggregator for periodic reports."
  - title: "Batch Storage Path"

  - title: "Alert Path"

test_results:
  analytics:
    heading: "Real‐Time Analytics Stream (Working)"
    status: success
    details: |
      From CameraArray (CA):
      - Every image sent as “real‐time” follows NZ→SP→AD→AL, generating anomaly alerts correctly when conditions are met.
      - In parallel, images follow SP→FE→AG→AL; feature reports arrive at AlertSystem without errors.
      This confirms the real‐time analytics branches (AD and FE→AG) and AlertSystem functions are operational.
  batch:
    heading: "Batch Storage Stream (Failing)"
    status: failure
    details: |
      From Normalizer (NZ):
      - Every image marked for archiving follows NZ→CP→ST but fails to appear in Storage (ST).
      - No explicit “error” is logged—images are simply not stored.
      This indicates the archival (batch) path is broken somewhere between NZ, Compressor, and Storage.
  spot_checks:
    heading: "Spot‐Checks at Each Device"
    status: info
    details: |
      - CameraArray: Captures frames and forwards correctly to Normalizer for both real‐time and batch.
      - Normalizer: Outputs standardized images to both Splitter and Compressor; logs confirm correct operation.
      - Splitter: Confirmation logs show two identical streams forwarded to AD and FE for each image.
      - AnomalyDetector: Detects anomalies in test images and sends alerts to AlertSystem; operator receives alerts.
      - FeatureExtractor: Extracts features and forwards to Aggregator; Aggregator combines and sends to AlertSystem successfully.
      - Aggregator: Receives features, builds report, and sends to AlertSystem; all reports are logged at AlertSystem.
      - AlertSystem: Receives anomaly alerts and aggregated reports without issue.
      - Storage: Remains empty of new archives despite batch runs.
      - Compressor: Sensor logs indicate compression steps occur, but no output arrives in Storage.

      status: success
  note: |
    All handshake tests succeed—no device is offline or disconnected.  Real‐time analytics devices all respond and log correctly; batch path devices respond to handshakes, though archives never appear in Storage.

hints:
  - "Notice that real‐time analytics (CA→NZ→SP→AD→AL and CA→NZ→SP→FE→AG→AL) function perfectly, so AD, FE, AG, and AL are all healthy."
  - "Batch archival (NZ→CP→ST) is the only path failing; both NZ→CP and CP→ST handshakes succeed, so physical connectivity is intact."
  - "Since Normalizer (NZ) forwards correctly to both Splitter and Compressor, the issue must be deeper in the batch pipeline."
  - "Storage (ST) receives no archives, but Storage’s handshake to Compressor succeeds—Compression is happening but Storage never records any new images."
  - "Therefore the fault lies in the Compressor’s internal logic that should forward compressed archives to Storage."

validation:
  correct_answer: "CP"
  success_feedback: "Correct! Compressor (CP) is faulty. Although it responds to handshakes from Normalizer and Storage, it fails to actually send compressed archives to Storage."
  failure_feedback: "Incorrect. The faulty device is Compressor (CP). Real‐time analytics work end‐to‐end, and all handshakes succeed, but no batch archives reach Storage, indicating a flaw inside CP."
