title: "Automated Package Sorting System Troubleshooting Exercise"
overview: |
  This simulation presents an automated package sorting system. Incoming packages are conveyed in, scanned for destination,
  and then diverted to one of two sorters (Zone A or Zone B). After sorting, packages merge back, undergo weight and label checks,
  and move out to the shipping dock. Use the information below to identify the faulty device or link, given that one handshake has failed.

test_results:
  zone_a:
    heading: "Zone A Packages (Working)"
    status: success
    details: |
      A batch of Zone A packages travels through InfeedConveyor → ScanStation → Diverter → SorterA → MergeStation
      → WeightChecker → LabelPrinter → OutfeedConveyor and all reach the shipping dock correctly, with accurate weights and labels.
  zone_b:
    heading: "Zone B Packages (Failing)"
    status: failure
    details: |
      A batch of Zone B packages follows InfeedConveyor → ScanStation → Diverter → SorterB → MergeStation
      → WeightChecker → LabelPrinter → OutfeedConveyor but never appear at MergeStation. They seem to stall immediately after Diverter.
  spot_checks:
    heading: "Spot‐Checks at Each Device"
    status: info
    details: |
      - InfeedConveyor: Packages move onto the belt without issue.
      - ScanStation: Barcode scans correctly identify Zone A or Zone B for test packages.
      - Diverter: Indicator LEDs show correct redirection to SorterA for Zone A packages; correct green diversion for Zone B.
      - SorterA: Receives Zone A packages and pushes them onto MergeStation—confirmed by sensor logs at MergeStation for Zone A.
      - SorterB: Sensor at SorterB’s input shows Zone B packages arriving, but no packages exit toward MergeStation.
      - MergeStation: Merges only Zone A outputs; no Zone B packages observed merging.
      - WeightChecker: Receives merged packages and logs normal weights for Zone A; no Zone B packages reach it.
      - LabelPrinter: Receives labeled Zone A packages; no Zone B packages.
      - OutfeedConveyor: Moves Zone A packages to docking area; empty for Zone B slot.

        status: success
      - pair: "LP → OC"
        status: success
    note: |
      All handshakes succeed except the Diverter → SorterB link, which fails.  This suggests a connectivity or responsiveness issue specifically between Diverter and SorterB.

hints:
  - "Zone A packages traverse the entire system successfully, proving SorterA, MergeStation, WeightChecker, LabelPrinter, and OutfeedConveyor are functional."
  - "Zone B packages stall right after Diverter. Sensors show they reach SorterB’s inlet, but no packages exit SorterB."
  - "Ping from Diverter to SorterB fails, while Diverter to SorterA succeeds—indicating the link or SorterB itself is unresponsive."
  - "Because SorterB’s handshake fails, the device is either offline or misconfigured internally."

validation:
  correct_answer: "SB"
  success_feedback: "Correct! SorterB (SB) is faulty. Its handshake with the Diverter fails, and Zone B packages never exit toward MergeStation, confirming SorterB is the culprit."
  failure_feedback: "Incorrect. The faulty device is SorterB (SB). The handshake test Diverter → SorterB fails, and Zone B packages stall at SorterB, while Zone A processing proceeds normally."
