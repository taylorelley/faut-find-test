title: "Automated Bottle Processing Line Troubleshooting Exercise"
overview: |
  This simulation presents an automated bottle processing line. Bottles are filled, capped, then split 
  for parallel leak and weight testing before merging back to be labeled, quality-checked, and packed.
  Multiple symptoms arise from a single device failure. Use the information below to identify the misbehaving device.

test_results:
  leak_tests:
    heading: "Leak Testing (Failing)"
    status: failure
    details: |
      A test batch of bottles flagged for leak testing follows BF→CP→SP→LT, but LeakTester reports 
      a high number of leaks (leak rates exceed acceptable threshold). Many bottles show fluid seeping 
      around the cap area, even though upstream machines appear to function correctly.
  weight_tests:
    heading: "Weight Checking (Failing)"
    status: failure
    details: |
      In the same batch, bottles routed to WC show underweight readings (missing cap weight). 
      WeightChecker logs indicate bottle weights consistently 5–7g below spec, matching the missing 
      cap mass. This suggests caps may not be applied properly.
  label_tests:
    heading: "Label Alignment (Inconsistent)"
    status: failure
    details: |
      Bottles that do proceed past Merger (despite failing earlier tests) reach the Labeler, 
      but sensors detect misaligned labels on about 30% of bottles. Manual inspection shows 
      labels sometimes wrap around the neck instead of the body, likely due to unstable cap placement.
  spot_checks:
    heading: "Spot-Checks at Each Machine"
    status: info
    details: |
      - BottleFiller: Fills bottles to correct volume; sensors confirm fill level is within tolerance.
      - Capper: Appears to engage but torque-sensor logs show irregular torque readings (some successful, 
        some very low or zero torque).
      - Splitter: Verification logs confirm bottles are correctly sent to LeakTester or WeightChecker.
      - LeakTester: Physically receives bottles and reports leaks; no mechanical jams detected.
      - WeightChecker: Receives bottles and registers underweight; scale calibration verified by test masses.
      - Merger: Combines both streams without jams; bottles flow freely to Labeler.
      - Labeler: Applies labels but misplacements occur; camera logs capture poor alignment correlating with 
        loosely-capped bottles.
      - QualityCheck: Inspects only bottles that pass upstream; passed bottles are accepted without issue.
      - Packer: Packages accepted bottles normally; throughput unaffected for good bottles.

      - pair: "BF → CP"
        status: success
      - pair: "CP → SP"
        status: success

      - pair: "LB → QC"
        status: success
      - pair: "QC → PK"
        status: success
    note: |
      All handshake tests succeed—no machine is completely offline or disconnected. Connectivity between 
      every pair is confirmed.

hints:
  - "Both LeakTester and WeightChecker report failures for the same set of bottles, suggesting a common upstream issue."
  - "Weights are missing cap mass, and leaks occur around the cap area—points to Capper misapplying or not tightening caps."
  - "Labeler misalignment correlates with unstable caps; labels slip when the cap isn't seated properly."
  - "Handshake tests between Capper and surrounding machines succeed, so the Capper is powered and connected."
  - "Combine leak, weight, and label alignment symptoms to pinpoint the root cause."

validation:
  correct_answer: "CP"
  success_feedback: "Correct! The Capper (CP) is faulty. Irregular torque readings, leaks detected around cap area, underweight readings (missing cap mass), and misaligned labels all stem from improperly applied caps."
  failure_feedback: "Incorrect. The faulty device is the Capper (CP). LeakTester and WeightChecker both report issues that trace back to improperly applied caps, and Labeler misalignments align with cap instability."
